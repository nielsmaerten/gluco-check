# Gluco Check Will Shut Down on June 13th

### [Google Is Shutting Down Voice-Based Apps on Google Assistant](https://developers.google.com/assistant/ca-sunset)

This means Gluco Check will no longer work after June 13th, 2023, along with all other apps you could invoke by saying:
> Hey Google, talk to [app name]

## Alternatives
We've started a [discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/nielsmaerten/gluco-check/discussions) to try and figure out where we go from here.

### TL;DR

- Amazon Alexa seems to be the most viable alternative right now:
  - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/toIqWbIfgRo
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyRkYw2iZfc
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyRkYw2iZfc
- Some of us (including myself) have switched to Home Assistant.
- Avoid Google products, since they all seem to end on [KilledByGoogle.com](https://killedbygoogle.com).
