##  Why is Nightscout not accepting my API secret / token?

API Secrets and Tokens are two different things. Gluco Check requires a **token**. Click the link below the token field for a detailed explanation on how to create one. Tokens look like this: `glucocheck-864c7a60ac08`

## How do I ask Gluco Check for [___] ?

Say: *"Hey Google, ask Gluco Check to read my [___]"*.  
Followed by:

| Metric           | Synonyms                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Blood sugar      | glucose, sugar, BG                   |

### Other questions you can try (experimental)

* How old is my sensor? How old is my pod?
* How many carbs do I have?
* How much insulin do I have left?
* *"Hey Google, talk to Gluco Check"* (without any metrics) will read out your personal selection.

## Can I use my own invocation?

Yes! If the Google Assistant supports Routines for your language, you can follow [these instructions](https://nightly.diabase.app/assets/routines-setup.mp4) to add your own invocations.  

For example, you can shorten *"Hey Google, ask Gluco Check to read my sugar"*  
to: *"Hey Google, check my sugar"*
