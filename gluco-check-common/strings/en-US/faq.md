## How do I ask Gluco Check for... ?

###  a specific metric

Say: **Hey Google, ask Gluco Check to read my [blank]**.  
Substitute **[blank]** with the name of any metric, OR a synonym:

| Metric           | Synonyms                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Blood sugar      | glucose, sugar, BG                   |
| Carbs on board   | carbs, COB, carbohydrates            |
| Insulin on board | insulin, IOB                         |
| Sensor age       | sensor                               |
| Infusion set age | infusion set, cannula, catheter, pod |
| Pump battery     | battery                              |
| Pump reservoir   | insulin remaining, reservoir         |
| *Everything*     | *all values, all of it*              |

### my personal selection

Say: **Hey Google, talk to Gluco Check** without specifying a metric.  
Assistant will now read the values you selected on https://diabase.app.

### multiple metrics

Say: **Hey Google, ask Gluco Check to read my *[blood sugar]* and *[sensor age]***  

## Other questions you can try (experimental)

* How old is my sensor? How old is my pod?
* How many carbs do I have?
* How much insulin do I have left?

## Can I use a custom invocation?

Yes!  
If Google Assistant supports [Routines](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7029585?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en) for your language,  
follow [these instructions](https://diabase.app/assets/routines-setup.mp4) to create your own invocations. For example:

| Instead of...                                      | say:                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Hey Google, ask Gluco Check to read my blood sugar | Hey Google, check my sugar |

##  Why is Nightscout not accepting my API secret / token?

*API Secrets* and *Tokens* are not the same thing.  
To use Gluco Check, you'll need a *token*. A token looks like this: `glucocheck-1d2a6bc59`.
