# Gluco Check is shutting down on June 13th, 2023 ðŸ˜¢

Google has announced they are removing voice-based apps from Google Assistant.  
You can read more about it here: https://developers.google.com/assistant/ca-sunset

In light of this, I am no longer accepting new pull requests and/or translations for Gluco Check.  
You can keep using Gluco Check in English, Dutch, Spanish and German until Google kills the service on June 13th.

After this date Gluco Check, along will all voice-based apps, will no longer be available.  
That means all apps you could invoke by saying: "Hey Google, talk to \<app name\>"

Thanks to everyone who used Gluco Check and Nightscout Status over the past 5 years.  
Thanks to everyone who helped build this app. Thanks [David D'Amico](https://github.com/ddamico) for your invaluable help!   
Thanks to everyone who submitted and reviewed translations.

And fuck Google for choosing profit over people.
