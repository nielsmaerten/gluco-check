These file make up the Action definition for Google Assistant.

## Pull: get the currently published version
`gactions pull --clean --force`
NOTE:  
--force will overwrite existing files, make sure any changes are stashed or committed!  
--clean removes all files (except dot-files, such as this one)

## Push: deploy the files to Google Assistant
`gactions push`
NOTE:  
Google must approve every update to PROD, so running this command won't change the live version.
