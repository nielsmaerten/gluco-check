## Getting started

1. [Link your Nightscout site](https://glucocheck.app)
1. During bèta, we have to manually activate your account.  
   You'll get an email as soon as your account is ready. (Usually within 24 hours)
1. Say: **"Hey Google, talk to Gluco Check"**  

## Things you can ask Gluco Check

* Blood sugar
* Insulin on Board
* Carbs on Board
* Sensor age
* Infusion set age
* Pump battery level
* Pump reservoir level
* [And more](https://glucocheck.app/faq)

## Protip: Using a shorter invocation

Use [Routines](https://glucocheck.app/assets/routines-setup.mp4) to turn "Hey Google, ask Gluco Check my blood sugar" into  
"Hey Google, check my sugar".

Note: Routines are not supported in all languages.
